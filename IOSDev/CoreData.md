Managed Object Context

> Its primary responsibility is to manage a collection of Managed Objects (Entities). A Managed Object Context maintains the state of entities, typically in memory.
> 
>  It provides Caching, Change tracking, Lazy loading, Redo, Undo and validation features

Persistent Store Coordinator (PSC)

> The persistent store coordinator role is to manage multiple/single stores and present to its managed object contexts the facade of a single unified store as shown below in the figure coordinator communicating to multiple stores.

Persistent store

> You can think of a persistent store as a database file (Sqlite) where individual records each hold the last-saved values of a managed object (Entity).
>
> Core Data also provides an in-memory store that lasts no longer than the lifetime of a process
>
> We can make multiple persistent stores per stack
>
> Core Data offers three native file types for a persistent store: binary, XML, and SQLite. You can implement your own store type if you want Core Data to interoperate with a custom file format or server
